This code is for the tracker published in the following paper.
Bohan Zhuang, Huchuan Lu, Ziyang Xiao, Dong Wang, Visual Tracking via Discriminative Sparse Similarity Map.

The code runs on Windows 7 with MATLAB 2012b.

The main tracking function is in test.m and the parameters related to image sequences are set in setTrackParam.m

The results are slightly sensitive to affine parameters. You may obtain better results by adjusting the parameters. 

This is the first version of code. We appreciate any comments/suggestions. For more quetions, please contact us via zhuangbohan2013@gmail.com
